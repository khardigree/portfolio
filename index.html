      <p>
        Hello! My name is Kait. Welcome to my page! Like the projects provided
        below, I made it myself! Please feel free to take a look around. <br />
        I am an aspiring full stack web-developer with experience in office
        administration in leadership positions. I am looking to change careers
        in order to find something that challenges me both logically and
        creatively. My current skills include: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
