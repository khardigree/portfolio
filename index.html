        <h2>Welcome to my page! Like the other projects on this page, I made it myself! </h2>
        <p>
            With background experience in payroll and administration in team leadership positions, I found myself looking for something that could challenge me both logically and creatively. That's when my career in software development started!
            I have attached my resume and links to my completed projects. Please feel free to look around.
